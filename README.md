# Hey, I'm Ash AKA Ashish AroraðŸ‘‹

I haven't reached what some might call "**greatness**" yet, but I'm on a journey of self-improvement and discovery. At a remarkably young age, I found myself at a crossroads, forced to make pivotal decisions. Looking back, it's hard to judge whether those choices were right or wrong, but I believe time will reveal their true significance.

Around the ages of 12 to 14, I gravitated towards technology, particularly computers. It wasn't just about ease or convenience; there was a genuine fascination rooted in a past triumph. Winning a robotics competition in high school ignited a spark within me, albeit fueled partly by luck. Reflecting now, I realize my skills weren't exceptional back then, nor are they now. But what matters is the continuous journey of growth and improvement.

Despite lacking significant support, I refuse to let that be an excuse. I'm determined to carve my path because I believe I have something meaningful to contribute. Life has thrown its fair share of challenges my way, shaping me into someone I never thought I'd become. In my high school days, I admit, **I wasn't the best version of myself**. I was untrustworthy, sometimes even hurtful to those closest to me, especially my mom. The memory of those actions weighs heavily on my conscience.

Yet, from those darker times, I've gleaned invaluable lessons. There's a belief that everything happens for a reason, and while it's often hard to see in the moment, hindsight brings clarity. I've undergone a profound transformation, from someone who once saw life as meaningless and tiresome to someone **determined to make each day count**.

Now, my focus is on making the rest of my days, and those of my family, truly worth living. I'm committed to working tirelessly not just for my own sake but for the countless hardworking individuals who deserve a fair chance. My goal? To disrupt the status quo, to dismantle the barriers that hold people back, and to create a better reality for us all.

And That's All for the day --stay connected to read old boring talks....
